# FriendFinder

This is a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application, similar to a dating app.
It takes the results from the user's survey and compares them to others results determining who is your most compatible friend. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
This app uses express to handle routing and is deployed in Heroku so other users can fill it out.
