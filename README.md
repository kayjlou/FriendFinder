# FriendFinder

This is a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application, similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

This app uses express to handle routing and is deployed in Heroku so other users can fill it out.
